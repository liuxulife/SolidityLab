# üß™ Guardian - Solidity Lab

Welcome to the Solidity Lab!

This is a community aimed at building and sharing a wealth of blockchain and solidity knowledge to help developers/auditors of all levels transform the web3 ecosystem.

Apply to join [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScHMxP3LTU96heRoV8DHeEEK1YIKqtbOWcT4cK9lAUkx0ZyUQ/viewform) ‚¨ÖÔ∏è

### What Is Solidity Lab?

In Solidity Lab you'll get the opportunity to:

* Share and learn from others interested in Solidity security
* Get direct answers about the latest security practices from active auditors
* Access curated security-focused Twitter posts, blog articles, videos, and more
* Get daily puzzles and "spot-the-bug" challenges
* Team up with others and participate in practice audits
* Join professional auditors in a "shadow audit" of a real blockchain project

On this site you'll find:

* An Encyclopedia containing information on all known Solidity attack vectors
* An Encyclopedia containing information on all known common Solidity bugs
* The Auditor's Handbook, a collection of guides for all things auditing



### The Vision

Empower an open, trustless, decentralized transaction layer; that anyone can build on with widespread access to the resources necessary to protect against bugs and exploits.



### The Mission

To accomplish the vision, the community must align on cultivating world-class auditors at scale.

We must radically adhere to our core values and take every chance to make it easier to access, study, and practice Solidity security.

Each and every community member is the most valuable resource at hand.



### The Core Values

* Thorough Without Exception
* Long Term Oriented
* Leverage Focused
* Constantly Curious
* Vehemently Passionate
* Inherently Collaborative
