# 5âƒ£ After The Audit

### Continued Review

After delivering the report, make yourself available for any clarifications/advice on resolutions.

Be sure to review the amendments made to each finding and validate that they fully resolve the original issue and do not create new ones.

If the amendments are significant they may constitute a new audit. Contracts may need to go through several stages of audits until they are ready for deployment.
